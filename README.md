That said, writing code is only part of the broader set of processes required to deliver great software, and these processes could be the key to truly seeing business outcomes in this revolution. I believe that organizations that embrace a modern approach to planning, product-centric thinking, DevSecOps, test automation, application security, automated code scanning and more will be poised to further differentiate themselves in an AI world.

Businesses that can safely and securely adopt AI-assisted coding approaches will likely be at a competitive advantage.
